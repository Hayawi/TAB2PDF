Requirements
   Converting ASCII notes to PDF
        - Convert the lines (vertical and horizontal) from ASCII note to PDF lines
        - Convert the numbers into their positions in the PDF
        - Calculate the SPACING between the notes
        - Place in the symbols (s, h, p, etc.) into their respective representations in the PDF
        - Decide on whether we are using a ‘Drag-and-Drop’ functionality
        - Simple UI enough to be usable by average computer users
        - Recommended to stay in Java but other languages/libraries are allowed
        - Venture off on our own without Professor’s aid, but only if the skeleton is finished early (maybe web application?)
        - Speed doesn’t matter, as long as it works
        - ‘Help’ option for average users but removable for the experts. User’s manual is necessary but opening it is optional
        - Easy to navigate through the program
        - Return error messages if input file is corrupt or incomplete
        - Multiple inputs/outputs to differ us from the other groups
        - If the header is missing (or any none-vital part) then the program should run without it (as long as music is there then it all goes)
        - Documented user manual. Since we decided on it, then a video instruction manual should be available too
        - As long as it works in Eclipse then all is well, also in Java
        - Use Github to transport or transfer our program to different places
        - HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE BIG SCREEN!
