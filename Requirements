      -	Convert the lines (vertical and horizontal) from ASCII note to PDF lines
      -	Convert the numbers into their positions in the PDF
      -	Calculate the SPACING between the notes
      -	Place in the symbols (s, h, p, etc.) into their respective representations in the PDF
      -	Decide on whether we are using a ‘Drag-and-Drop’ functionality
      -	Simple UI enough to be usable by average computer users
      -	Recommended to stay in Java but other languages/libraries are allowed
      -	Venture off on our own without Professor’s aid, but only if the skeleton is finished early (maybe web application?)
      -	Speed doesn’t matter, as long as it works
      -	‘Help’ option for average users but removable for the experts. User’s manual is necessary but opening it is optional
