The design is meant to have a large amount of modularity.  Where the only data needed to construct a 
Tablature object is a string of all the text in the ascii file.  The Tablature object has methods
which change it's state.  Then the Tablature object is passed to the writePDF utility 
class which creates a pdf file and applies all the corresponding methods for the settings to the 
documents.
